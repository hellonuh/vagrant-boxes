# vagrant-boxes
This repository contains all the vagrant base boxes that I use for development
Each folder contains the steps to create a box and then use it for development
The boxes are build with oraclelinux vagrant base box

## prerequisite
- vagrant installed on your machine
- virtualbox

If you want to know more about vagrant or virtual box you can google it. 
The process is quite straight forward.
